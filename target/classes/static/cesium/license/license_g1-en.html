<p><strong>Money licensing and liability commitment.</strong></p>
<p>Any certification operation of a new member of Ğ1 must first be accompanied by the transmission of this license of the currency Ğ1 whose certifier must ensure that it has been studied, understood and accepted by the person who will be certified.</p>
<h2 id="money-1">Money Ğ1</h2>
<p>Ğ1 occurs via a Universal Dividend (DU) for any human member, which is of the form:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 DU per person per day</li>
</ul>
<p>The amount of DU is identical each day until the next equinox, where the DU will then be reevaluated according to the formula:</p>
<ul>
<li>DU <sub>day</sub> (the following equinox) = DU <day>(equinox) + c² (M / N) (equinox) / (15778800 seconds)</day></li>
</ul>
<p>With as parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>c = 4.88% / equinox</li>
<li>UD (0) = 10.00 Ğ1</li>
</ul>
<p>And as variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>_M_ the total monetary mass at the equinox</li>
<li>_N_ the number of members at the equinox</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="web-of-trust-1-wot-1-">Web of Trust Ğ1 (WoT Ğ1)</h2>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Certifying is not just about making sure you&#39;ve met the person, it&#39;s ensuring that the community Ğ1 knows the certified person well enough and Duplicate account made by a person certified by you, or other types of problems (disappearance ...), by cross-checking that will reveal the problem if necessary.</p>
<p>When you are a member of Ğ1 and you are about to certify a new account:</p>
<p><strong>You are assured:</strong></p>
<p>1°) The person who declares to manage this public key (new account) and to have personally checked with him that this is the public key is sufficiently well known (not only to know this person visually) that you are about to certify.</p>
<p>2a°) To meet her physically to make sure that it is this person you know who manages this public key.</p>
<p>2b°) Remotely verify the public person / key link by contacting the person via several different means of communication, such as social network + forum + mail + video conference + phone (acknowledge voice).</p>
<p>Because if you can hack an email account or a forum account, it will be much harder to imagine hacking four distinct means of communication, and mimic the appearance (video) as well as the voice of the person .</p>
<p>However, the 2 °) is preferable to 3 °, whereas the 1 °) is always indispensable in all cases.</p>
<p>3 °) To have verified with the person concerned that he has indeed generated his Duniter account revocation document, which will enable him, if necessary, to cancel his account (in case of account theft, ID, an incorrectly created account, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Abbreviated WoT rules:</strong></p>
<p>Each member has a stock of 100 possible certifications, which can only be issued at the rate of 1 certification / 5 days.</p>
<p>Valid for 2 months, certification for a new member is definitively adopted only if the certified has at least 4 other certifications after these 2 months, otherwise the entry process will have to be relaunched.</p>
<p>To become a new member of WoT Ğ1 therefore 5 certifications must be obtained at a distance &lt; 5 of 80% of the WoT sentinels.</p>
<p>A member of the TdC Ğ1 is sentinel when he has received and issued at least Y [N] certifications where N is the number of members of the TdC and Y [N] = ceiling N ^ (1/5). Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>For 1024 &lt; N ≤ 3125 we have Y [N] = 5</li>
<li>For 7776 &lt; N ≤ 16807 we have Y [N] = 7</li>
<li>For 59049 &lt; N ≤ 100 000 we have Y [N] = 10</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the new member is part of the WoT Ğ1 his certifications remain valid for 2 years.</p>
<p>To remain a member, you must renew your agreement regularly with your private key (every 12 months) and make sure you have at least 5 certifications valid after 2 years.</p>
<h2 id="software-1-and-license-1">Software Ğ1 and license Ğ1</h2>
<p>The software Ğ1 allowing users to manage their use of Ğ1 must transmit this license with the software and all the technical parameters of the currency Ğ1 and TdC Ğ1 which are entered in block 0 of Ğ1.</p>
<p>For more details in the technical details it is possible to consult directly the code of Duniter which is a free software and also the data of the blockchain Ğ1 by retrieving it via a Duniter instance or node Ğ1.</p>
